# Documentation Exercises

This is a lightning talk exhorting you to add Documentation Exercises to your projects.

Documentation exercises are not just exercises *in* your documentation, but also **for** your documentation. The idea is that users who want to learn about your project should attempt to complete the exercises *using only the documentation*, and report any problems that they find.
